Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this tutorial will guide you through the essential concepts and features of JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as interactive forms, animations, and real-time updates. JavaScript is also used in game development and mobile app development, making it a versatile tool in a developer's toolkit.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

JavaScript is an essential skill for web developers. It is supported by all modern web browsers and is a key component of web technologies alongside HTML and CSS. Learning JavaScript opens up opportunities for building web applications, enhancing user experiences, and even developing server-side applications with Node.js. Additionally, JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which are widely used in the industry.

## Getting Started

To start coding in JavaScript, all you need is a text editor and a web browser. You can write JavaScript code directly in an HTML file or use external JavaScript files. Let's begin with a simple example:

```html showLineNumbers
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
