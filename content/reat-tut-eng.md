Welcome to the React Tutorial! In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will help you understand the core concepts of React and how to build dynamic web applications.

React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build reusable UI components.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to build single-page applications and allows developers to create reusable UI components. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, and was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.

React's main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To start using React, you need to set up your development environment. This involves installing Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Once you have these tools installed, you can create a new React application using Create React App, a tool that sets up a new React project with a sensible default configuration.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Install a Code Editor**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Create a New React Application**: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:
   ```bash showLineNumbers
   npx create-react-app my-app

4. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**: 
   ```bash showLineNumbers
   cd my-app

4. **Start the Development Server:**: 
   ```bash showLineNumbers
   npm start
